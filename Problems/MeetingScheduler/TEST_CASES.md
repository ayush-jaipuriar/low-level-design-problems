To thoroughly test the Meeting Scheduler LLD problem, we should consider various scenarios and edge cases. Here are some possible test cases:

1. Test case: Book a single meeting
   - Input: `book(2, 5)`
   - Expected output: "Atlas" (assuming Atlas is the first available room)

2. Test case: Book multiple non-overlapping meetings in the same room
   - Input:
     ```
     book(2, 5)
     book(6, 8)
     book(9, 11)
     ```
   - Expected output: "Atlas", "Atlas", "Atlas"

3. Test case: Book multiple meetings in different rooms
   - Input:
     ```
     book(2, 5)
     book(3, 6)
     book(4, 7)
     ```
   - Expected output: "Atlas", "Nexus", "Holycow"

4. Test case: Book overlapping meetings
   - Input:
     ```
     book(2, 5)
     book(4, 7)
     ```
   - Expected output: "Atlas", "Nexus"

5. Test case: Book a meeting when no rooms are available
   - Input:
     ```
     book(2, 5)
     book(3, 6)
     book(4, 7)
     book(5, 8)
     ```
   - Expected output: "Atlas", "Nexus", "Holycow", "No rooms available"

6. Test case: Book meetings with the same start and end times
   - Input:
     ```
     book(2, 5)
     book(2, 5)
     ```
   - Expected output: "Atlas", "Nexus"

7. Test case: Book meetings with start time equal to end time
   - Input: `book(4, 4)`
   - Expected output: "Atlas"

8. Test case: Book meetings with end time before start time (invalid input)
   - Input: `book(6, 4)`
   - Expected output: "Invalid input" or appropriate error message

9. Test case: Book a meeting with a large time range
   - Input: `book(1, 100)`
   - Expected output: "Atlas"

10. Test case: Book a meeting with negative start or end times (invalid input)
    - Input: `book(-2, 5)`
    - Expected output: "Invalid input" or appropriate error message

11. Test case: Book a meeting with non-integer start or end times (invalid input)
    - Input: `book(2.5, 6)`
    - Expected output: "Invalid input" or appropriate error message

12. Test case: Book meetings in a specific order to test room assignment priority
    - Input:
      ```
      book(2, 5)
      book(3, 6)
      book(4, 7)
      book(5, 8)
      book(6, 9)
      ```
    - Expected output: "Atlas", "Nexus", "Holycow", "Nexus", "Holycow"

These test cases cover various scenarios, including booking single and multiple meetings, overlapping meetings, unavailable rooms, edge cases with start and end times, invalid inputs, and testing the room assignment priority.
