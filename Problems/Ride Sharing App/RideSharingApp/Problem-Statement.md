Based on the problem statement provided in the PDF file and the transcript describing the implementation steps, here's a sample GitHub README.md file content for the ride-sharing LLD problem:

# Ride-Sharing Application

This repository contains the implementation of a ride-sharing application, designed to meet the requirements specified in the problem statement.

## Problem Statement

Design a ride-sharing application where drivers can offer rides (origin, destination, number of seats), and riders can request rides (origin, destination, number of seats). The application should calculate the ride amount charged based on the following rules:

1. If the number of seats occupied is greater than or equal to 2, the ride amount is calculated as: `Number of kilometers * Number of seats * 0.75 * Amount charged per KM`
2. If the number of seats occupied is 1, the ride amount is calculated as: `Number of kilometers * Amount charged per KM`

The program should take input for two or more drivers and a set of riders requesting rides. Multiple rides can happen simultaneously.

Assumptions:
- Amount charged per KM = 20
- Number of kilometers = |destination - origin|
- All values are integers

## Requirements

The application should support the following functionalities:

- Add Driver (name)
- Add Rider (name)
- Create Ride (id, origin, destination, number of seats)
- Update Ride (id, origin, destination, number of seats)
- Withdraw Ride (id)
- Close Ride and return the ride amount charged

Additionally, the application should handle the following bonus requirements:

- Upgrade a rider to a "preferred rider" if they have completed more than 10 rides.
- For preferred riders, apply a discount on the ride amount:
  - If the number of seats occupied is greater than or equal to 2, the ride amount is calculated as: `Number of kilometers * Number of seats * 0.5 * Amount charged per KM`
  - If the number of seats occupied is 1, the ride amount is calculated as: `Number of kilometers * Amount charged per KM * 0.75`

## Implementation

The implementation of the ride-sharing application follows an object-oriented design approach and is written in Java. The main classes involved are:

1. **Person**: Base class representing a person with a name attribute.
2. **Driver**: Extends the `Person` class and represents a driver in the system.
3. **Rider**: Extends the `Person` class and represents a rider in the system. It maintains a list of completed rides and provides methods for creating, updating, withdrawing, and closing rides.
4. **Ride**: Represents a ride with attributes like id, origin, destination, number of seats, and ride status. It also includes methods for calculating the fare based on the provided rules.
5. **RideUtility**: A utility class containing static methods for calculating the fare amount based on different scenarios.

The implementation follows the principles of modularity, extensibility, and separation of concerns. It handles edge cases and error scenarios gracefully, and the code is legible, readable, and follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. Identified the key classes: `Ride`, `Person`, `Driver`, and `Rider`.
2. Defined the `Person` class with a `name` attribute.
3. Defined the `Driver` and `Rider` classes, both extending the `Person` class.
4. Defined the `Ride` class with attributes like `id`, `origin`, `destination`, `seats`, and `rideStatus` (an enum).
5. Implemented the `calculateFare` method in the `Ride` class to calculate the fare based on the provided rules.
6. Defined the `Rider` class with methods for creating, updating, withdrawing, and closing rides.
7. Implemented the `createRide` method in the `Rider` class, handling input validation and setting the ride properties.
8. Implemented the `updateRide` method in the `Rider` class, checking for ride status and updating the ride details.
9. Implemented the `withdrawRide` method in the `Rider` class, checking for ride status and withdrawing the ride.
10. Implemented the `closeRide` method in the `Rider` class, checking for ride status, calculating the fare, and adding the ride to the completed rides list.
11. Created a separate `RideUtility` class to encapsulate the fare calculation logic.
12. Moved the `calculateFare` method and the `AMOUNT_PER_KM` constant to the `RideUtility` class.
13. Updated the `Rider` class to handle multiple bookings from a single user at a given time.
14. Removed the `currentRide` variable and renamed `completedRides` to `allRides`.
15. Modified the `closeRide` method to take a ride ID as an argument.
16. Updated the `updateRide` and `withdrawRide` methods to use iterators to find the ride based on the provided ID.
17. Created a test class with various test cases to verify the functionality of the application.

## Usage

To run the application and execute the test cases, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/ride-sharing-app.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd ride-sharing-app`
3. Compile the Java files: `javac *.java`
4. Run the test class: `java RideShareAppTest`

The test class will execute various test cases, and the output will be displayed in the console.
